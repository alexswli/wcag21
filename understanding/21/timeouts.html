		<h1>Understanding Timeouts</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p>The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users with certain cognitive disabilities, as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online form.</p>
			<p>Users with certain cognitive impairment may become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and data input required to complete an online process. The user may not be able to complete the process in one sitting and may need to take breaks. Ideally, users should be able to leave a process without losing data that have already been entered. Many users will often be unable to complete a task correctly if they cannot take a break and check their work.</p>
			<p>For situations where timing (e.g., an auction and airline reservation) or protection of data (e.g., online banking) is essential, it is important to warn users about the time limitation. Notifications should include information about the length of time restriction. For example, the user should be notified of the time limit upon logging in that the banking site will automatically log out the user and delete unsubmitted data after a specific length of inactivity. In case of real-time events with uncertain expiration time, such as purchasing of concert tickets, the site can provide an estimated time.</p>
			<p>Another way to meet this success criterion is to preserve data entered by the user for 20 hours or longer. This predicates on user authentication and consent of data preservation prior to data entry and requires user to re-authenticate after the timeout. Where applicable, this approach can potentially offer additional data protection while enabling users with certain cognitive disabilities to continue without data lose.</p>
			<p>This success criterion only applies to timeouts that are within the content providers knowledge or control. For example, it is not a violation of the success criterion to loses unsubmitted content when the internet connection disconnects, the user closes the web browser, or device powers off.</p>

			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p>This Success Criterion helps users who need additional time performing tasks or reading content. Users can take breaks and check their work. This enables them to complete tasks online that they otherwise could not do.</p>
			<p>This Success Criterion helps people with many different cognitive disabilities, including people with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> language-related disabilities; </li>
				<li> memory-related disabilities; </li>
				<li> focus-and-attention-related disabilities; and </li>
				<li> disabilities that affect executive function and decision making. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user with a cognitive disability may not remember required information (e.g., a phone number or a zip code) that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive impairment. </li>
				<li>Users with cognitive disabilities may need additional time to look up the information required to complete a transaction, without losing their place in the process, and without losing data that have already been entered.</li>
				<li>Usersâ€™ cognitive skills may temporarily diminish as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day, and continue it when they are feeling better, and when their reading or processing skills are back to their higher levels.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<section id="sufficient">
				<h3>Sufficient</h3>
				<p class="instructions">Techniques that are sufficient to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion.</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Set session timeout to take place after 20 hours or more of inactivity </li>
					<li> Provide autosave </li>
					<li> Provide a warning about the estimated or exact length of inactivity that would generate a timeout without data preservation</li>
				</ul>
